# Git tasks

## Part 1

1. Print your current working directory and double check you are inside a directory called `remote_precourse_week_1`

2. List directory contents including all the files starting with a `.`. Double check you have a `.git` repository inside the directory.

3. Add a `useful_commands` directory into your `day_1` directory and start creating some manual files for some of the commands you learnt earlier today e.g. `ls` command could have a file called `ls_manual.md`. Once you've added your text file then you can stage and commit. Remember to give each commit a brief and meaningful message. Remember to print a list of all the commits you've created once you've added a new commit to your repository.

4. One of the git commits in the history has a really bad name - can you find it and research a way of updating the commit message of this commit.
