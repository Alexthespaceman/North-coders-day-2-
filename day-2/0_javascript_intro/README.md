# Javascript intro tasks

## `message.js`

There is a problem with `message.js` - correct the syntax in this file in order to correctly print the message to the terminal.

## `challenges`

- In each of the files in here you will find a line of code that is commented out.

For each file you will need to:

1. un-comment the line of code
2. Write a few of your own comments predicting what will be printed to the the terminal. You could look this up but its perhaps better for you to try and use your intuition to help guide you in these tasks.
3. Then execute the file with node and check your terminal to see what gets printed.
