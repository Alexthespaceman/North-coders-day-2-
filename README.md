Each section is organised into **practice**, **challenges**, and **questions**

## Tasks

- `exercises` 🖊️ - these tasks are designed for you to practice some of the essential skills in a particular topic

- `challenges` 🧠 - tasks in here are designed to make you practice building/implementing functions that must fulfil certain behaviour. They are designed to encourage you to think and problem solve independently and also make sense of instructions.

- `questions` ❓ - these tasks are designed to make you think critically about a given concept. They may employ a Predict observe explain format requiring you to think or comtemplate a particular scenario and explain what will happen

- `explore` 🎨 - these tasks are purposely open-ended and designed to bring out your creative side. Coding is often about finding creative or imaginative solutions to problems and these tasks aim to get you thinking in this sort of way.
