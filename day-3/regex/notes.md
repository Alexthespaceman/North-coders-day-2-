# Regular expressions

A regular expression or _regex_ is a pattern which is designed to find matches within a body of text. They are frequently used in search engines, word processors and online forms.

In JavaScript, a regex pattern is denoted with an opening and closing forward slash `/`. For example `/i'm a js regex!/`

## Literal Characters
We can use literal characters when we are sure that a specific character needs to appear in the pattern. For example, if we want to test some text to determine whether it had the characters `dog` in that order, we could construct the following regex.
```js
/dog/  // our regex to find the dog üêï

"dog" ‚úÖ //we have a match!
"catcatcatdogcatcatcat" ‚úÖ //also a match
"DOG" ‚ùå //the regexes are by default case-sensitve so this wouldn't match
"dgo" ‚ùå //we have the right characters, but they are not in the right order.
```

## Metacharacters
Metacharacters are not interpreted literally. They are used to give the regex the ability to match more complex patterns rather than a string of literal characters. We can use square brackets to wrap a list of characters we are looking for. Unlike the previous example, using a character set, `/[dog]/` will match any _single_ character found with the `[]`.

We can be less specific about the characters we are looking for as well:

**\d** - matches any numerical character.

**\w** - matches any alphanumerical character as well as underscores.

**\s** - matches whitespace characters.

If we want match patterns based on a certain location in the text, we can make use of **anchors**:

**^** - matches the beginning of the text.

**$** - matches the end of the text.

To use a metacharacter as a literal matcher, prepend it with a `\` eg. `\$`


## Quantifiers
We can be specific about the number of characters we are interested in.

`[abc]{3}` would match exactly three consecutive characters from within the character set. eg. aab, bbb, or abc.

`[abc]{3,6}` would match the same characters but the length can be between 3-6 characters long. _NB: regex will be greedy by default and match the largest pattern if it can._

**+** checks there are _one or more_ within the text. **\*** is similar but works on the basis there is _zero or more_ matches.
eg. 
```js
/[abc]+!*/ // matches one or more of the characters in the charcter set followed by zero or more exclaimation marks. 
```

## Flags
A regex is commonly appended with a series of letters. These are known as _flags_ and alter the behaviour of how the regex works. They can be chained together (but be warned, some flags override the behaviours of others). eg. `/[a-z]/gi`
Here is a list of some commonly used ones:

**g** - global flag. Tells the regex to check the whole passage of text for matches. Without this flag, the regex would only pick up the first match it comes across.

**i** - case insensitive flag. With this flag activated, the regex will not differentiate between upper and lower case characters.

**m** - multiline flag. This changes the behaviour of the start, `^` and end `$` anchors. By default they match the beginning and end of the entire body of text. With the multline flag set to true the regex will consider each line to have a start and end.
