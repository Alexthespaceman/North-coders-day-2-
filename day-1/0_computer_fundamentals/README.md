# Day 1 tasks

## Command line tasks

### Part 1

1. Use the command echo to print your a message "hello <your-name>" to the terminal

2. Print your current working directory to the terminal

3. Change directory back to your home directory and then use mkdir to create a new directory called northcoders

4. Change directory into the northcoders directory and print your current working directory again - always double checking where you are.

5. Create some directories inside northcoders called precourse, fundamentals, frontend random_stuff and mentor_meetings

6. List all the directory contents of northcoders and you should have the 5 directories you've just created.

7. Create a new file in your mentor_meetings directory called questions.txt - look up the commands to do this if you need to: you can find some good documentation [online here](http://oliverelliott.org/article/computing/tut_unix/)

8. Use the cd command to navigate to the northcoders directory.
